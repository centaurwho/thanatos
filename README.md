# Thanatos

Thanatos is my attempt at a bare-bones operating system. It is written in Rust and targets the x86_64 architecture. Main 
inspiration for this project comes from [Philipp Oppermann's blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/). As of now, I am following
his blog to get a basic understanding of how to write an operating system. I will be using his bootloader for now, but
will eventually (probably never) write my own.

### Goals
